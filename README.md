# Project Repository for Java Exercises

This repository contains four Java exercises designed to enhance object-oriented programming skills, implement data management concepts, and explore practical applications of Java in various domains. Below is a detailed description of each exercise, including the objectives, classes implemented, and key functionalities.

## 1. Customer Order Management System
This exercise focuses on developing an application for managing customer orders in a computer sales company. The application facilitates the following functionalities:

- **Entities Managed**:
  - **Ordinateur**: Represents computers available for sale, with attributes such as:
    - `marque` (Brand)
    - `prix` (Price)
    - `description` (Description)
    - `nbrStock` (Stock Quantity)
    - `categorie` (Category)
    - The class includes a method `getPrixPourQuantite(int quantite)` to calculate the total price based on the ordered quantity.
  
  - **Categorie**: Groups computers into specific categories, allowing for organization and management. It includes:
    - `nom` (Name)
    - `description` (Description)
    - `ordinateurs` (List of Computers): Methods to add or remove computers from the category.

  - **Client**: Represents customers of the company, containing details such as:
    - `nom` (Last Name)
    - `prenom` (First Name)
    - `email` (Email Address)
    - `telephone` (Phone Number)
    - This class also manages a list of past orders made by the client.

  - **Commande**: Represents an order placed by a client with attributes like:
    - `reference` (Order Reference)
    - `dateCommande` (Order Date)
    - `etatDeCommande` (Order Status)
    - `client` (Client): A reference to the client who placed the order.

  - **LigneCommande**: An associative class that links a specific computer to a customer order, including:
    - `quantit√©` (Quantity)
    - `commande` (Order): A reference to the associated order.
    - `ordinateur` (Computer): A reference to the associated computer.

## 2. Library Management System
This exercise involves creating an application to manage books and library members. Key features of the system include:

- **Entities Managed**:
  - **Livre** (Book): Represents a book with attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
  - **Adherent** (Member): Represents library members, storing personal details and a list of borrowed books.

- **Functionalities**:
  - Adding and removing books from the library.
  - Registering new members.
  - Checking out and returning books with appropriate tracking of availability.
  - Searching for books and members based on specific criteria.

## 3. Product Management with Interface Implementation
In this exercise, the focus is on manipulating a collection of product objects using lists and interfaces, providing a solid understanding of Java collections and polymorphism. 

- **Key Components**:
  - **Produit**: Represents products with the following attributes:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for the product.
    - `nom`: Name of the product.
    - `marque`: Brand of the product.
    - `prix`: Price of the product.
    - `description`: Description of the product.
    - `nombreEnStock`: Stock quantity available.

  - **IMetierProduit**: An interface that declares essential methods for managing product objects, including:
    - `add(Produit p)`: Adds a product to the list.
    - `getAll()`: Returns a list of all products.
    - `findByNom(String motCle)`: Finds products whose names contain the specified keyword.
    - `findById(long id)`: Retrieves a product by its ID.
    - `delete(long id)`: Deletes a product by its ID.

  - **MetierProduitImpl**: This class implements the `IMetierProduit` interface and manages a list of products. It provides concrete implementations for all methods defined in the interface, leveraging Java Streams for efficient querying.

- **User Interaction**: The application presents a console-based menu allowing users to perform operations such as adding, searching, retrieving, and deleting products interactively.



## Conclusion
These exercises aim to strengthen Java programming skills, emphasizing the use of object-oriented principles, data management techniques, and interface implementation. Each exercise is designed to be modular, well-documented, and can be executed independently. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of practical programming exercises that are suitable for both learning and reference purposes.
